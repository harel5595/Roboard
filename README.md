Hi There!
Welcome to Roboard - the interactive robot-board writing technology.
in this folder, you should have 10 files:
* Roboard.exe -> the compiled executable that can communicate with the robot to write whatever you want!
* Roboard.cpp -> the code for roboard for roboard.exe. if you compile this you get roborad.exe. it is documented, so the user guide appears in the comments. 
* Roboard.h -> the h file of Roboard.cpp
* Coder Manual (word file) -> the manual for coders who wish to alter Robord.cpp

* textCompiler.py -> the python script that can compile text into compiled Roboard instruction files. it is documented, the coder guid is inside of the script.
* alphabet.py -> the font script for the compiler to use
* textCompiler_MAN -> the user guide for this script

* roboard_script.py -> this script encapsulates the functionality of this entire module. it can be used to write whatever text you wish on the board with a single cmomand line. this is again documented, the coder manual is the comments.  (as the file doesn't have functions but main(), there isn't a lot to explain except for its flow.)
* roboard_script_MAN -> the user guid for this script

* video file

an additional resource you may use is the p5js script: https://editor.p5js.org/EyalLitvin/sketches/FEs8_GBHp.
it is just used to transform compiled text files into the picture they represent, for debugging porpouses. feel free to use it by changing the content of the "lines.txt" file in the online editor to your file.
you also have to update the region of coordinates you are working on on the upper/lower_x/y varriables.
than when you press "play" it should display the lines of your file.
